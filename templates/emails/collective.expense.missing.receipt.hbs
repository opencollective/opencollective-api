<p>
A card attached to <a href="{{config.host.website}}/{{collective.slug}}">{{collective.name}}</a> was charged {{currency expense.amount currency=expense.currency}} for {{fromCollective.name}} and we need the responsible admin to input additional information.

For accounting reasons, the Fiscal Host will need a description and receipt. The card may be suspended if receipts are not provided.
