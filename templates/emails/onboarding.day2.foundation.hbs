<h1>Hey {{collective.name}} ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>Weâ€™ll be sending you a couple emails with tips to help you get up and running.</p>

<p>Our top advice for you right now:

<ul>
<li>Fill in your "about" section and upload a logo and cover image by clicking on those sections of <a href="https://opencollective.com/{{collective.slug}}">your page</a>.</li>
<li>To help people find you, add tags (like "mutual aid", "open source", or "Chicago") in <a href="{{config.host.website}}/dashboard/{{collective.slug}}">your settings</a>.</li>
<li>It's time to start fundraising! Share the link to your page far and wide, and read more about <a href="https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/financial-contributions">how people can donate</a>.</li>
<li>You can <a href="https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/embed-contribution-flow">embed the contribution flow</a> on your own website, so people don't have to leave your page to donate to your Collective.</li>
