<h1>Hey {{collective.name}} ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>Have you customized <a href="{{config.host.website}}/dashboard/{{collective.slug}}/tiers">your contribution tiers</a>? Think about how to entice financial contributors by giving them some options!</p>

<p>There are lots of other great features to help you raise and spend money, and build your community.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/events">Events</a>: A great way to engage, online or offline. Ticket sales go to your Collective budget.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/expenses">Expenses</a>: The way to spend money! You can <a href="">submit one yourself</a> or <a href="">invite someone to submit an expense</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/tiers-goals">Goals</a>: Let people know what you're aiming for and track progress. You can even create <a href="https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/tiers-goals#force-standalone-page">standalone crowdfunding campaign pages</a>.</li>
