<h1>Hey {{collective.name}} ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>I noticed that you haven't published any Updates yet. Updates are a great way to let everyone know what you've been up to, share exciting news, and let your contributors know what their generosity is enabling.</p>

<p>Engaging your community is often the key to a Collective's success. Share regular updates about your progress, and share the challenges, too. Your community wants to know how things are going!</p>

<p>Check out our <a href="https://documentation.opencollective.com/advanced/keeping-your-community-updated">Updates and Communication documentation</a>, and let us know if you need any help.</p>
