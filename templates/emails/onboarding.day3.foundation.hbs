<p>We hope you've had a chance to get set up and look around. How's it going so far?</p>

<p>Here are some more helpful tips:

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/communication">Updates</a> are a great way to tell your story. They go out as an email newletter and up as a blog post on your page. We'd love for you to post at least one a quarter! <a href="https://opencollective.com/foundation/updates">OCF's own Updates</a> are a great way to find out about new services and important announcements.</li>
  <li>Check out stories and case studies of diverse groups using the platform <a href="https://blog.opencollective.com">on the blog</a>. We'd love to feature a post about yours, too!</li>

  <li>Keep in mind our <a href="https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/processes-and-limitations">rules and policies</a> when it comes to things like non-US activity, political lobbying, contracts with third parties, in-person fundraising events, outside entities, and outside accounts.</li>
  <li>Did you know you can get a <a href="https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/processes-and-limitations/virtual-cards-policy">virtual card</a> (like a debit card), <a href="https://docs.opencollective.foundation/what-we-offer/about-grantmaking">make grants</a>, get <a href="https://docs.opencollective.foundation/what-we-offer/liability-insurance">liability insurance</a>, and sign up for <a href="https://docs.opencollective.foundation/what-we-offer/emails">free email accounts</a> through OCF?
