  <ul>
    <li>
      Why should I trust this email?
      <p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 4px;">
        This email was sent by Open Collective, the platform that processes the financial contributions for {{> linkCollective collective=collective}}.
        You can verify that the email is from us by checking the email address in your inbox and all links point toward our official domain, <a href="https://opencollective.com">https://opencollective.com</a>. This process, along with other payment-related topics, is explained
        in detail on our <a href="https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/payments#credit-card-verification">public documentation</a>.<br/>

      Why does this happen?
      <p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 4px;">
        To secure online payments, it is sometimes required to confirm payments with a second factor authentication. This happens today mostly in Europe but this is being deployed in more countries over time.
        In Europe, the policy is named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_customer_authentication">Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)</a> and the most common way of authenticating
        an online card payment relies on 3D Secure, which asks you to confirm the payment through your phone, banking app, or dedicated device.<br/> 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      What will happen if I don't verify my credit card?
      <p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 4px;">
        If you don't verify your credit card, we will not be able to process your {{order.interval}}ly payment to {{> linkCollective collective=collective}}.
        We will retry in the coming days, then after 6 attempts your recurring contribution will be cancelled.<br/>
