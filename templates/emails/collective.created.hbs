<h1>Hey {{collective.name}} ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>Iâ€™m PÃ­a, the CEO and co-founder of Open Collective. Iâ€™d love to help you get your {{accountType}} up and running. Feel free to reply to this email. I'm here to help!</p>

{{#if host}}

<p>
  {{#if hostPending}}
  Your {{accountType}} is pending approval for Fiscal Hosting by (<a href="https://opencollective.com/{{host.slug}}">{{host.name}}</a>).
  Your Host will hold money on behalf of your {{accountType}}.
  Once approved, your {{accountType}} will be able to receive money.
  {{else}}
  Your {{accountType}} is hosted by <a href="https://opencollective.com/{{host.slug}}">{{host.name}}</a>.
  Your Host will hold money on behalf of your {{accountType}}.
  Once approved, your {{accountType}} will be able to receive money.
  {{/if}}
</p>

{{else}}

<p>
  Your {{accountType}} doesn't have a Fiscal Host yet. A Host is an entity that holds money on behalf of {{accountType}}s. They take care of things like accounting, invoicing, and tax reporting.
  If you are looking for one to join, you can <a href="https://opencollective.com/hosts">browse existing Hosts</a>.
  Or, if you already have an entity who can hold funds on behalf of your {{accountType}}, it can <a href"https://docs.opencollective.com/help/fiscal-hosts/become-a-fiscal-host">become a Fiscal Host</a>.
</p>

{{/if}}

<p>While you are waiting to get set up with a Fiscal Host, you can <a href="https://opencollective.com/{{collective.slug}}/admin">head to your settings</a> to customize your page and add team members. You can also submit expenses and post updates.</p>
