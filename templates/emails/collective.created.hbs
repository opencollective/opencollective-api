<h1>Hey {{collective.name}} ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>Weâ€™d love to help you get your {{accountType}} up and running.</p>

{{#if host}}

<p>
  {{#if hostPending}}
  Your {{accountType}} is pending approval for Fiscal Hosting by (<a href="https://opencollective.com/{{host.slug}}">{{host.name}}</a>).
  Your Host will hold money on behalf of your {{accountType}}.
  Once approved, your {{accountType}} will be able to receive money.
  {{else}}
  Your {{accountType}} is hosted by <a href="https://opencollective.com/{{host.slug}}">{{host.name}}</a>, which will hold money on its behalf.
  {{/if}}
</p>

{{else}}

<p>
  In order to receive money, you need to specify where funds will be held. You can either sign up with a <a href="https://opencollective.com/fiscal-hosting">Fiscal Host</a>, which will take care of things like accounting, banking, and tax reporting for you, or you can be an <a href="https://docs.opencollective.com/help/independent-collectives">Independent Collective</a> and hold money in your own bank account.
</p>

{{/if}}

<p>There are lots of options and features to explore for your {{accountType}}, so <a href="{{config.host.website}}/dashboard/{{collective.slug}}">head to your settings</a> to customize your page and add team members.</p>
