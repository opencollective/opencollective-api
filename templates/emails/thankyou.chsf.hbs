<p>As a CH member, you get 1 free event per month. To get your free event, all you have to do is type in the email address you used to register for membership in eventbrite's purchase ticket section "<a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/opencollective/image/upload/v1515428737/Screen_Shot_2018-01-08_at_4.02.31_PM_qydkx7.png">Enter Promotional Code"</a> ...and your coded access will be accessed! </p>
