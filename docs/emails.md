# Developing with Emails

## Receiving Emails

- Start mailpit server with: `npm run mailpit`
- Open `http://localhost:1080` to browse outgoing emails

## Email Templates

Email templates can be viewed locally by running `npm run compile:email <template name>` and making sure there is data for that template in `scripts/compile-email.js`.
